<img class="resize" src="/img/Pam_for_portfolio.png" alt="Pam">Hi, my name is Pam Willenz, I am a Digital Media/Project Manager with experience in health communications, project management and tech consumer learning. After working for a tech startup, I decided I wanted to take a deep-dive into the technology world and learn software development, web development. Please check out my [resume](https://github.com/PamBWillenz/resume). 

Visit my [GitHub page](https://github.com/PamBWillenz) to see my code and apps. Here in my portfolio, I share some of the apps I've built.

Besides my technical side, I live with my family (Mike and Pixel, the cat) in Northern Virginia, near Washington, DC. I enjoy the outdoors, especially cycling, hiking, swimming, skiing and pretty much anything outside. I also love to cook and am experimenting with Green Chef and all the fabulous recipes.

Pam
